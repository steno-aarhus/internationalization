## Online seminars

Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus (SDCA) has online seminar series on
diabetes research as part of its internationalization of their research
strategy towards the Latin America Region. These online seminars will
run over a year with the purpose of knowledge exchange and establishing
a network of collaborators with common research interests.
