    "text": "Although the burden of diabetes increasingly affects people in low-middle income countries (LMIC), most diabetes research is still performed in developed countries. This creates a local knowledge gap that ranges from adequate prevalence and incidence estimates for diabetes and its complications; expertise in the setup of locally adapted prevention strategies, and wider processes for state-of-the-art handling and analysis of complex and large data repositories. This knowledge gap adds a layer of complexity for implementing solutions to tackle the burden of diabetes in LMIC contexts.\nThrough internationalization of research, Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus (SDCA) aims to position itself in the wider global diabetes community both by sharing its expertise (outward) as by learning from experiences elsewhere (inward). SDCAâ€™s current international research network is heavily oriented to European, Australian, Canadian and US partners. The overall aim of this project is to broaden the internationalization research strategy of SDCA by creating and expanding research and learning networks with institutions from the Latin America Region, specifically from Mexico, Peru, and Brazil.\nThis project will initially take mostly a bottom-up approach, fostering direct educational and research collaboration connections between researchers. The initiatives will initially be online. As they expand in the second phase of the project, the consolidation of the networks will likely increasingly need support from at the organizational level, for example in the form of letters of intent or collaboration agreements. The longer term vision is for these collaborative networks to lead to the establishment of partnerships, joint grant applications and joint knowledge sharing channels.\nThe internationalization of the research strategy will be implemented within a three year time horizon. Each year represents a different stage in the process with a specific focus within each stage.\nBring the people together. The purpose of this stage is to establish a network of collaborations that share common ground.\nProject development. Once established the international networks, this stage will aim to develop the basis of joint research projects in the form of co-authorships, or co-supervision of students. Strengthening the international collaboration at this stage has the purpose to evolve partnerships into potential collaborative projects, and grant co-applications. It will be relevant at this stage to identify potential funding agencies that could be targeted at a later stage.\nFunding co-application & collaborative projects. The aim of this stage is to submit funding co-applications with the international partners, and carry out collaborative projects."
